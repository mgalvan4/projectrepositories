    <p id="subtitle">What can I help <strong>you</strong> with?"
  </header>
  <div>
    <p>Take a look at what I got. Here are some resources from padlet I'd like to embed. I've also got some research articles I'd like to try and show the abstract of at a later point. Finally I will try and organize everything per topic: <em>things like grief, disability resources, and rehablitation</em></p>
    <section>
      <h2>Grief and Trauma</h2>
      <p>With some CSS the iframes should function appropriately, ability to copy the link functions</p>
      <iframe src="https://padlet.com/buddysplace2000/2023-camps-and-additional-resources-cxerv8icborpyhhy" title="Collection of resources dedicated to children who have lost parents or siblings as well as resources for their guardian"></iframe>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Disability Resources</h2>
      <p> As I get more experience this semester I will be able to update this with links, articles, and webpages displaying resources for a range of people with disabilities to take advantage of, my primary focus and area of research relates to Autism Spectrum Disorder, I will try to section the content accordingly for easier navigation"</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Help Needed: Volunteer with Non-Profits</h2>
    <p> <a href="https://chhamh.org/volunteer" title="Coffee, Hip-Hop and Mental Health volunteer page that will be updated with opportunities">Coffee,Hip-Hop, and Mental Health</a> is a non-profit coffee shop that operates to provide community members with mental health services they would not normally be able to acquire"</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Related News</h2>
      <p> This will be a regularly updated section that will be dedicated to spreading awareness for current events and journalism with information pertinent to the disability community.</p>
      <p> All suggestions for this section will be curated and when this is not related to a project for class under which suggestions will be normally offered then I will create an area on the page itself where suggestions can be entered, likely attached to an email.</p>
    </section>

  <footer>
    <p>I am not a licensed counselor nor have I fully completed my bachelors in science at the time of writing this February 2023, please bear this in mind if you are to take advice from the resources displayed. I will do my best to curate what is displayed, but some links are dynamic and science develops.</p>
